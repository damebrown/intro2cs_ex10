I discussed the exercise with: Michael Berelejis, Yotam Amrani, Tomer Bashiri.

=  README for ex(10): decision trees =
======================================


==================
=  Description:  =
==================
in this ex we were asked to build a few methods for pre-build classes,
functions that built and analyze decision trees.

==================
=  Resubmission: =
==================
changes I've made for the resubmission:
- In the original file, in the 'find illness' function that sets the leave's
    data, I accidently returned a Node type element instead of a string type
    (this was the major bug).
- I added edge cases in which the symptoms list is empty
- Added a reference to the case in which there is no one most common illness
    in the find illness function. in that case an illness is randomized.
